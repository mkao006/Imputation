\title{Plot Ensemble and Model Fits}
\usage{
plotEnsemble(data, modelFits, modelWeights, ensemble,
  returnFormat = "faceted")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The data.table containing the data being imputed.}

\item{modelFits}{A list of length equal to the number of models.  Each
element of the list should be a numeric vector of length nrow(data). This
object is usually created by computeEnsembleFit.}

\item{modelWeights}{A matrix of dimension nrow(data) x length(modelFits).
Each element corresponds to the weight for model/column j and for
observation/row i.  Note: modelFits and modelWeights need not have the same
ordering, but they should have the same names as this is how they are
matched.}

\item{ensemble}{A numeric vector containing either the original data (if it
was not missing) or the imputed value (if the original data was missing).}

\item{returnFormat}{In what format should the plots be returned?  If "faceted", a
single plot showing with all countries is returned.  If "individual", a
list with ggplot objects is returned.  If "prompt", the first country's
plot is displayed and then the user must press ENTER to cycle through the
plots.}
}
\value{
If returnType = "faceted" or "prompt", then no value is returned
(but a plot is generated).  However, if returnType = prompt, then a list of
ggplot objects is returned.
}
\description{
This function plots each of the individual models in the ensemble as well
as the initial data and the final ensemble.  This function is not meant to
be called directly by the user but instead is a helper function called by
ensembleImpute (if the argument plot = TRUE).
