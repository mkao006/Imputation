##' Helper function for defaultLogistic
##' 
##' This function fits a logistic model to the data via logistic regression
##' (see ?glm and the binomial family).  To ensure all x values are between
##' 0 and 1, the values are all divided by the maximum x value.  Thus, this
##' model assumes the asymptote is the largest observed x value.  Time is the
##' independent variable and is the vector 1:length(x).
##'
##' @param x The dependent variable.
##' 
##' @return A numeric vector of the same length as x but with the model
##' estimates at each point in time.  Note: if the logistic model has it's
##' midpoint outside the range of the data, this function will return a vector
##' of NA's (as the original defaultLogistic function had this behavior to
##' prevent poor fitting).
