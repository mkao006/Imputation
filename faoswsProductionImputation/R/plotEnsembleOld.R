##' Plot Ensemble and Model Fits (Old)
##' 
##' This function plots each of the individual models in the ensemble as well
##' as the initial data and the final ensemble.  This function is not meant to
##' be called directly by the user but instead is a helper function called by
##' ensembleImpute (if the argument plot = TRUE).  This function differs from
##' plotEnsemble in that it uses the original plotting code (base graphics
##' instead of ggplot2).
##' 
##' @param data The data.table containing the data being imputed.
##' @param modelFits A list of length equal to the number of models.  Each
##' element of the list should be a numeric vector of length nrow(data). This
##' object is usually created by computeEnsembleFit.
##' @param modelWeights A matrix of dimension nrow(data) x length(modelFits).
##' Each element corresponds to the weight for model/column j and for 
##' observation/row i.  Note: modelFits and modelWeights need not have the same
##' ordering, but they should have the same names as this is how they are
##' matched.
##' @param ensemble A numeric vector containing either the original data (if it
##' was not missing) or the imputed value (if the original data was missing).
##' @param value The column name of data containing the variable being imputed.
##' @param byKey The column name of data containing the grouping variable.
##' @param yearValue The column name of data containing the time variable.
##' 
##' @return No value is returned, but a plot is generated.
