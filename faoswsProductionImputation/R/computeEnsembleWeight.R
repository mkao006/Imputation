##' Function to compute the weights of the ensemble models
##'
##' @param data A data.table containing the data.
##' @param cvGroup A vector of the same length as nrow(data).  Entries of the
##' vector should be integers from 1 to the number of cross-validation groups
##' (typically 10).  This should be randomly assigned, and is usually created
##' by ensembleImpute.
##' @param fits The fitted values from the models.
##' @param method Must be either "inverse" or "stacking".  If "inverse", the
##' final ensemble is a weighted average of all the individual models, where
##' the weight of each model is proportional to 1/error from that model.  If
##' "stacking", then the weight is assigned via a linear regression (where the
##' independent variable in the regression is the variable being imputed, and
##' each individual model is a dependent variable).  The linear regression is
##' restricted, however: no weights may be negative and the weights must sum to
##' one.
##' @param imputationParameters A list of the parameters for the imputation
##' algorithms.  See defaultImputationParameters() for a starting point.

    ### If doing loocv, compute a new fits object
    if(errorType == "loocv")
        fits = computeLoocvFits(data = data, cvGroup = cvGroup)
    
    ### Compute the actual weights by passing to another function
    if(method == "inverse"){
        weights = getInverseWeights(data, fits)
    } else if(method == "stacking"){
        weights = getStackingWeights(data, fits)
    } else {
        stop("Provide method is not currently implemented!")

    ### Apply adjustments to weights (NA->0, reduce below maximumWeights)
    weights[is.na(weight), weight := 0]
    if(restrictWeights & any(weights > maximumWeights)){
        # Assign weights exceeding the threshold a new value.  We want this new
        # value to be maximumWeights, but after reassigning this weight we have
        # to re-normalize the weights so they sum to 1.  The (1-weight)/(1-max)
        # factor ensures the final weight for this maximum case will be
        # maximumWeights.
        weights[weight > maximumWeights,
                weight := maximumWeights * (1 - weight) / (1 - maximumWeights)]
        # Re-normalize the weights so they sum to 1:
        weights[, weight := weight / sum(weight), by = byKey]
    }
    
    ### Convert weights to a matrix
    weights = getWeightMatrix(data = data, w = weights)
