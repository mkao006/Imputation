##' Default Logistic Model for the Ensemble.
##' 
##' The model fit is \eqn{ Production = A/(1 + exp(-B(time-C))) }, and
##' fitting is done via non-linear least squares (see ?nls).  If this fit fails
##' to converge, than A is fixed to the maximum Production value and the model
##' is fit via glm().
##' 
##' @note If the midpoint of the logistic regression model is outside the range
##' of the data, then a vector of NA's is returned (to prevent poor
##' extrapolation).
##'
##' @param x A numeric vector to be imputed.
##' @return A numeric vector with the estimated logistic regression model.
